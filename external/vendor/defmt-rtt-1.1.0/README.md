# `defmt-rtt`

> Transmit [`defmt`] log messages over the RTT (Real-Time Transfer) protocol

[`defmt`]: https://github.com/knurling-rs/defmt

`defmt` ("de format", short for "deferred formatting") is a highly efficient logging framework that targets resource-constrained devices, like microcontrollers.

The fastest way to get started with `defmt` is to use our [app-template] to set up a new Cortex-M embedded project.

For more details about the framework check the book at <https://defmt.ferrous-systems.com>.

## Memory use

When in a tight memory situation and logging over RTT, the buffer size (default: 1024 bytes) can be configured with the `DEFMT_RTT_BUFFER_SIZE` environment variable. Use a power of 2 for best performance.

## Support

`defmt-rtt` is part of the [Knurling] project, [Ferrous Systems]' effort at
improving tooling used to develop for embedded systems.
